{"transcript": "Woke up feeling so stressed and anxious. Had a meeting with the team about the new album and everyone was just nitpicking every little thing. Scooter was there and he was being his usual annoying self, constantly interrupting me and undermining my ideas. Went to the studio after to work on a new song but I couldn't focus, my mind was all over the place. Called Karlie later, she always knows how to make me feel better. Talked it out with her and she reminded me to take a step back and not be so hard on myself.", "emotions": ["Anxious", "Stressed", "Overwhelmed", "Frustrated", "Irritated"], "valence": [-7, -8, -7, -6, -6], "arousal": [8, 8, 8, 6, 7], "themes": ["Career", "Conflict", "Identity", "Friendship", "Power"], "timestamp": "2024-04-28T20:04:52.393Z"}
